# App Router

The App Router is Next.js’s answer to advanced routing needs, allowing for more complex patterns and setups.

## Structure:

Introducing a shift away from traditional structures, app router adopts a more modular and organized directory approach:

```
└── app
├── about
│ └── page.tsx
├── globals.css
├── layout.tsx
├── login
│ └── page.tsx
├── page.js
└── team
└── route.tsx
```

## Features:

**1. Client and Server Components**: Allows differentiation between components that run on the server versus the client. This offers greater optimization, especially when dealing with server-side operations versus client-side interactivity.

**2. Easy Layouts**: With `layout.js`, managing layouts becomes easier and more intuitive. Nested layouts further simplify hierarchical page structures.

**3. Server Actions**: This feature lets you execute server-side code based on client-side events.
Intercepting Routes: Provides a mechanism to render different components based on conditions, even if the URL remains the same.
Parallel Routing: Lets you render multiple pages on the same URL, enhancing flexibility.
Built-in SEO: App router introduces a built-in approach to handling metadata, making the `next/head` redundant.
Pros

**4. Flexibility** : Adapt to a wide range of routing scenarios.
Dynamic Data Handling: Seamlessly integrates with varying data sources.

## Cons

**1. Learning Curve:** Might be overwhelming for beginners.

**2. Optimization:** Requires additional efforts to ensure best performance.

**3. Pages Router**: The Pages Routing system is both intuitive and effective. By adding React components to the `pages` directory, routes are automatically established.

## Structure:

Historically Next.js used the `pages` directory to automatically generate routes based on the filenames:

```
└── pages
├── about.tsx
├── index.tsx
└── team.tsx
```

## Features:

**1. Automatic Routes:** Adding a `.js` or `.tsx` file to the `pages` directory automatically creates a route.

**2. SEO Optimization:** With the `next/head` component, SEO optimization was straightforward.

**3.Data Fetching Methods:** Included `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticPaths` for fetching data.

**4.Custom Document & App Component:** Allowed for customization of the overall document structure and layout.

## Pros

**1. Efficiency:** Next.js streamlines the development process, saving time.
SEO Ready: With server-side rendering, content is ready for both users and search engines.
Cons

**2. Complex Routes:** Might not be ideal for intricate routing needs.
Naming Convention: The structure is tied to file and folder names, demanding accurate naming.
