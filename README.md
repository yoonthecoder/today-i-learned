# today-i-learned 📝
Hey there! Welcome to my "Today I Learned" (TIL) repo. This is where I jot down little lessons I pick up along the way—whether it’s something cool I discovered, a tricky concept I finally wrapped my head around, or just a useful tool I stumbled upon. It’s a mix of topics, from coding techniques to tech fundamentals, all helping me track my learning journey.

Feel free to check out the different sections, and who knows, maybe you'll find something helpful too!
